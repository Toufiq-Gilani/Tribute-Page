        <h1>Al-Qa'qa' Ibn Amr al-Tamimi</h1>

        <p>
            Al-Qa'qa' Ibn Amr al-Tamimi was an Arab Muslim commander and general in the
            Rashidun army who belonged to the tribe of Banu Tamim. He and his tribe
            converted to Islam possibly during the time of Ahnaf ibn Qais.
            He is known as a successful military commander who took part in two
            important victorious battles in the early Muslim Conquest,
            the Battle of Yarmouk against the Byzantine Empire
            (commanded by Khalid ibn al-Walid) and the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah against
            the Sassanian Empire which was led by Saad ibn Abi Waqqas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Caliph Abu Bakr praised him as an equal to eleven thousand men so in
            return the caliph's successor, caliph Umar, only sent Qa'qā' and a handful
            of bodyguards in the first wave of reinforcements to Al-Qadissiyah.
            Qa'qā' was one of the most illustrious military figures of his era.

        <h2>Ridda wars</h2>

        <p>
            Qa'qa ibn Amr At-Tamimi converted along with his tribe, in the Year of the
            Delegations, 631. But, for a brief period, he and other Tamim joined the
            force of false prophetess Sajah bint al-Harith before she was subdued
            during the Ridda wars. Later on, he carried a successful military
            campaign under Khalid bin Walid, suppressing another false prophet
            Tulayha in the Battle of Buzakha. After the Ridda wars ended he
            continued to follow Khalid's campaign to Syria and Iraq.
        </p>

        <h2>Muslim conquest of Iraq and Syria</h2>

        <p>
            Qa'qa took part in the Battle of Chains and on one occasion when Qa'qa saw
            Khalid dueling the Sassanid champion Hormuzan, Qa'qa immediately rushed as
            he saw Hormuz sent 5 to 6 soldiers to aid him swarming over Khalid to
            intercept the duel. Then Qa'qa and Khalid overcame Hormuzan and his guards,
            killing all the Sassanid soldiers who intended to kill Khalid amid the duel
            in the process, along with Hormuzan. During this battle, it's reported that
            Qa'qa said: "We did trample Hormuz with fury restrained...".
        </p>

        <p>
            Later, as incensed Christian Arabs of this area sought revenge for their
            leader Aqqa who fell in the Battle of Al-Anbar, they contacted the Persian
            commander named Bahman who in turn divided the Persian-Arab forces into two
            field armies and sent them off from Ctesiphon. The first force under Ruzbeh
            moved to Husaid, and the other, under Zarmahr, moved to Khanafis. For the
            moment these two armies were located in separate areas for ease of movement
            and administration, but they were not to proceed beyond these locations
            until the Christian Arabs were ready for battle. Bahman planned to
            concentrate the entire imperial army to either await a Muslim attack or
            march south to fight the Muslims at Hira.
        </p>

        <p>
            This situation had been anticipated by Khalid before his arrival at Hira
            from Dumat Al-Jandal, as he divided the Muslim garrison of Hira into two
            corps, one of which he placed under Qaqa and the other under Abu Laila.
            Khalid sent them both to Ain-ul-Tamr, where he would join them a little
            later after the troops who had fought at Dumat Al-Jandal had been rested.
            The forces of Qa'qa consisted of two divisions of migratory tribe warriors
            named "The Righteous"(al-Bararah) and "The Best"(al-Khiyarah), whereas the
            al-Khiyarah division was led by 'Ismah ibn Abdallah.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the forces of Qa'qa' met Zarmahr in the Battle of Husayd, while Abu
            Laila met Ruzbih in Khanafis, Qa'qa' immediately commanded his forces
            to gallop forward, as per instruction of Khalid, whenever they met an
            enemy force on their march. Zarmahr in response immediately asked Ruzbeh,
            who was blocked by the forces of Abu Laila, to aid his forces rather than
            engage Abu Laila. Qa'qa' personally slew Zarmahr while Ruzbih in turn
            killed by 'Ismah. Thereafter the Muslims charged. As the battle continued,
            the Persians and their allies started to realize their losses and retreated
            to Khanafis.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the Persian garrison at Khanafis came to know of the Persian defeat
            at Huseid and of the death of their own Commander Zarmahr, Mabhuzab and
            his forces abandoned Khanafis and with his forces moved to Muzayyah further
            north, where more forces were available and defenses were stronger.
            When the Muslim forces under Abu Leila arrived at Khanafis, they found
            that there were no Persian forces to meet them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later, Khalid So make a detour to return to his main headquarter to
            rendezvous with Qa'qa' and Abu Laila further chasing the Persians and
            their Arab allies towards Muzayyah. Khalid rode on his camel instead of
            the horse during his return to Ayn al Tamr.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the famous battle of Yarmouk under Khalid, Qa'qa' served as Khalid's
            subordinate officer in the mobile guard elite cavalry. subsequently
            taking part in the 'Fire Brigade' role, plugging all weak points or
            reinforcing the routed line within the Muslim ranks.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattāb sent Al-Qa'qa' ibn 'Amr to take part in the
            battle of Qadisiyya. On 17 November 636, his units reached the battlefield
            at noon. Before arriving, Qa’qa divided his troops into several smaller
            groups and instructed them to appear on the battlefield one after
            the other, giving the impression that large reinforcements were
            arriving. Qa'qa was busy raising morale and arranging his companions
            to the place from where he parted from them the previous day.
            The Persian army's elephants were a serious obstacle for the Muslims.
            To solve this problem, Qa'qa resorted to an ingenious device.
        </p>

        <p>
            The camels in his army were disguised to look like weird monsters.
            These "monsters" were moved to the Sassanid front and, upon seeing them,
            the Sassanid horses turned and fled. With the disorganization of the
            Sassanid cavalry, the Persian infantry at the left and center became
            exposed and vulnerable. Saad ordered an all-out attack by the Muslims.
            After the Persian army was routed Qa'qa ibn Amr went into pursuit and
            killed the Persian general Bahman, who commanded the Sasanian army at
            the Battle of the Bridge.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the battle resumed on 18 November 636, al-Qa'qa' led a vanguard
            cavalry of three hundred, accompanied by Qays bin Hazim who led the
            Hashim tribe kinsmen from Syria together with local Iraqi tribal warriors.
            This time they were involved in melee combat against the Sassanid elephant
            corps. The Muslim cavalry blinded the elephants and severed their trunks
            with spears and other melee weapons while the Muslim archers struck down
            the elephant riders.
        </p>

        <p>
            The situation became dire for the Muslims later on that day,
            despite having already annihilated the elephant corps, because
            the Sassanids fought even more ferociously, resulting in al-Qa'qa's
            fellow kinsmen, Khalid bin Yamar al-Tamimi, being killed in the night.
            Consequently, al-Qa'qa' was tasked with the initiative of reinvigorating
            the Muslim army.
        </p>

        <p>
            At sunrise on 19 November 636, the fighting had ceased,
            but the battle was still inconclusive. Al-Qa'qa, with the
            consent of Saad, was now acting as a field commander of the
            Muslim troops. He is reported to have addressed his men as follows:
        </p>

        <pre>
        "If we fight for an hour or so more,
        the enemy will be defeated.
        So, warriors of the Bani Tameem,
        make one more attempt,
        and victory will be yours."
        </pre>

        <p>
            The Muslims' left center led by al-Qa'qa' surged forward and attacked
            the Sassanid right center, followed by the general attack of the
            Muslim corps. The Sassanids were taken by surprise at the resumption
            of battle. The Sassanids' left wing and left center were pushed back.
            Al-Qa’qa' again led a group of Mubarizun against the Sassanids'
            left center and by noon, he and his men were able to pierce through
            the Sassanid center.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the Battle of Jalula Mihran engaged his troops in an open
            battlefield, and Hashim ibn Utbah decided to carry out his maneuver.
            He dispatched a strong cavalry regiment under one of his most
            illustrious cavalry commanders, Qaqa ibn Amr, to capture the
            bridge over the entrenchments. The bridge was not heavily guarded
            as virtually all the Persian troops available were used to assault
            the Muslim army's main rank.
        </p>

        <p>
            Qa'qa maneuvered around the Persian right flank and quickly captured
            the bridge at their rear. The news of a strong Muslim cavalry detachment
            in their rear was a serious setback to Persian morale. Hashim launched
            a frontal attack with Muslim infantry while Qaqa was stuck at the Persian
            rear with his cavalry. Thus resulted the Sassanid Army was trapped and
            routed in result. After the campaign in Jalula was ended he stayed and
            held a military post for a while in Kufa.
        </p>

        <h2>Defense of Emesa</h2>

        <p>
            In 638, Emesa was laid siege by the coalition forces of Arab Christian
            tribes from Jazira which was mustered by Heraclius in an attempt to
            stimy the losses of Byzantine territories due to the rapid expansion
            of the Rashidun caliphate in the Levant.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the orders of Umar, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas immediately sent Qa'qa with
            4000 soldiers with him to aid the defenders of Emesa which was led by
            his former superiors during the battle of Yarmouk, Abu Ubaydah and
            Khalid ibn Walid. Later as the Christian Arab coalitions abandoned
            the siege, Khalid and Qa'qa immediately came out of the fort to pursue
            the enemy and inflicted heavy losses on the fleeing Arab Christian
            coalition forces.
